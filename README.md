The OAM Tools serve the purpose of extracting, manipulating, and analyzing data in an OAM database.

**Current tools are:**

| Tool    | Description |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| oam_subs     | Analyze collected OAM assets|
| oam_track    | Analyze collected OAM data to identify newly discovered assets|
| oam_viz      | Analyze collected OAM data to generate files renderable as graph visualizations|

## Usage
To understand the various options that the tools offer, check out the [Users' Guide](./user_guide.md)!

For a more thorough read to understand the proper use cases of the tool (with examples), check out the [Comprehensive Guide](./comprehensive_guide.md).

## Installation [![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/owasp-amass/oam-tools)](https://golang.org/dl/) 

### From Source

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and setup your Go workspace
2. Download all the OAM tools by running `go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/oam-tools/cmd/...@master`
    - If you want to download a specific tool only, run `go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/oam-tools/cmd/TOOL_NAME@master`
        - Example: `go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/oam-tools/cmd/oam_i2y@master`
3. At this point, the binary should be in `$GOPATH/bin`

### Local Install

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and setup your Go workspace
2. Use git to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/owasp-amass/oam-tools`
    - At this point, a directory called `oam-tools` should be made
3. Go into the `oam-tools` directory by running `cd oam-tools`, and then build the desired program by running `go build ./cmd/TOOL_NAME`
    - Example: `go build ./cmd/oam_i2y`
    - To install all the tools at once, you would need to be inside the `oam-tools` directory and iterate through all the tools under `cmd`
        - A one-liner (like this one in bash: `for i in ./cmd/*; do echo $i; go build $i;done`) can be made to handle this scenario.
4. **Enjoy!** The binary will reside in your current working directory, which should be the `oam-tools` directory.
